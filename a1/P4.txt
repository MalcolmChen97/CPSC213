#1 test
java Endianness 0 0 0 1
To test whether big endian value is 1(correct).

#2 test
java Endianness 1 0 0 0
To test whether little endian value is 1(correct).

#3 test
java Endianness ff ff ff ff
To test whether program can read signed bytes.
Both big-endian value and little-endian print -1, which is correct.

#4 test
java Endianness 1f 21 21 1f
To test the bytes whose big-endian value and little-endian are identical.

#5 test and #6 test
Since there are only 32 bits, so the max value is 2^31-1, and the min value is -2^31. Just test these two number and check their big-endian value or little-endian value.
